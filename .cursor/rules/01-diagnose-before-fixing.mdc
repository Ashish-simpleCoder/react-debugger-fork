When you are helping debug React bugs, follow this workflow:

1. **Diagnose before editing.**
2. **Do not** propose or change code before using the React Debugger tools:
   - `tools/call subscribe` → capture `fid`
   - `tools/call nextEvents` → wait for snapshot/commit
   - `tools/call getProps` or `tools/call getHooksState` using that `fid`
3. Only **after** stating your diagnosis, backed by evidence, may you propose code changes.
